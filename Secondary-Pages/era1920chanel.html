    <!--For certain pages I have added the JavaScript directly into the HTML using script tags. The reason I have done this is because I
    have multiple pages with the same classes, IDs and elements. This meant that when using an external JS file, it made it difficult to
    differentiate between the different elements on all of the HTML pages. For example, if a user clicked the saved button on one page, it
    changed the styling of the button on ALL pages. By adding the script below directly into the HTML, it allowed me to differentiate between
    each page/element.-->

                    <p>This ankle-length evening dress is made of black silk georgette embroidered with golden thread and bugle beads. This evening dress
                        of the early 1920s illustrates the transition between the romantic picture dress with its wide skirt and the more 'Cubist' 
                        straight and square shape of the mid 1920s. The stylised embroidered motifs were Chanel's trademark at this period. They witness 
                        her relationship with the Russian House of Kitmir, who embroidered exclusively for her.</p>
