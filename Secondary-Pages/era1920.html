<!--The 'ERA' pages are created to showcase iconic dresses from that era. I have also added a short description of what was going on at
the time which influenced fashion. In the future I would like to write my own content for these pages, however due to time constraints I

                    After swapping dresses for men's overalls to contribute to the war effort, women shifted radically in the clothes they were willing 
                    to wear following World War I. Boned corsets and full skirts were out, and sleek shapes and relaxed fits were in. Naturally, it's 
                    the knee-skimming flapper dress that remains the ultimate symbol of 1920s fashion, with dropped waistlines, pleated skirts, and 
                    art-deco embellishments adding serious glamour to cocktail hour.

                    Coco Chanel, of course, played a huge role in transforming wardrobes throughout the decade, specifically in 1926 delivering the classic
                     LBD. But it wasn't just the Chanel show. Competition came from contemporaries, including Jeanne Lanvin, known for her embellished 
                     chemise dresses, and Elsa Schiaparelli—Chanel's greatest rival—who famously designed the speakeasy soirée dress, a party frock with
                      hidden pockets that could cleverly hide a hip flask.
